## Project Description 
**Muser** is a web app to crowdsource music recommendations. We’ve found that there are a lot of avenues for exploring new music already, but nothing beats a person-to-person recommendation. Muser is essentially Tinder, but for music recommendations. We intend to have users link their Spotify Account to create a profile filled with their top tracks, artists, and genres. Additionally, users will have the option to include an ‘about me' where they can include music genres they are interested in exploring or any other relevant information.  Users will be able to swipe through a list of profiles, liking any that they share music tastes with or interested in learning more about. Someone who enjoys rap and wants to explore R&B might swipe on anyone with a music taste filled with R&B. Once matched, users will be able to chat through the music-specific chat feature integrated with the Odelsi/Songlink API to share music. Considering the premise of this project and to respect users’ privacy, we plan to only have a username as the only means of identification. Further, the integrated chat feature will be limited to sending music recommendations and setting a mood for preferences.
